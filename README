bricolage.cc Templates & Element Types 1.4
==========================================

This package contains all of the templates, element type definitions, and
output channel definitions (the latter two in XML, exported from the Bricolage
SOAP server) for the bricolage.cc Web site. It's not meant for direct import
into an existing Bricolage server, although it is possible to import the
output channels and element types.

To do so, you must modify the site tag in element_types.xml and
output_channels.xml. Then use bric_soap to import them into your Bricolage
server:

  /usr/local/bricolage/bin/bric_soap --username admin --password 'change me now!' site update sites.xml
  /usr/local/bricolage/bin/bric_soap --username admin --password 'change me now!' output_channel create output_channels.xml
  /usr/local/bricolage/bin/bric_soap --username admin --password 'change me now!' element_type update pull_quote.xml
  /usr/local/bricolage/bin/bric_soap --username admin --password 'change me now!' element_type create element_types.xml
  /usr/local/bricolage/bin/bric_soap --username admin --password 'change me now!' category create categories.xml

  bric_soap output_channel create output_channels.xml
  bric_soap element_type create element_types.xml

To get the templates to properly execute, make sure that the PERL_LOADER
bricolage.conf directive loads HTML::Entities and the burner mode constants:

  PERL_LOADER = use HTML::Entities; use Bric::Util::Burner qw(:modes);
