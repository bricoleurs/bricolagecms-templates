bricolage.cc Templates & Elements 1.21
======================================

This package contains all of the templates, element type definitions, and
element definitions (the latter two in XML, exported from the Bricolage SOAP
server) for the bricolage.cc Web site. It's not meant for direct import into
an existing Bricolage server, although it is possible to peform such a direct
import by modifying the Bricolage server and the "element_types.xml" and
"elements.xml" files. To do so, you must set up the following output channels
(or modify "elements.xml" to a similar model):

Output Channel     Includes
-----------------  ---------------
Library
XHTML              Library
Slugged XHATML     XHTML, Library
Archive            XHTML, Library
RSS                Library
Mason              Library
Introspect         Library

You must also set up the following Element Types:

  * Subelement
  * Related Story
  * Related Media and Story
  * Related Media
  * Fixed Document
  * Document
  * Image
  * Fixed Image
  * Fixed Files
  * Audio

Or, if you've installed Bricolage from "trunk" branch of the Subversion
repository, you can simply use the element_types.xml file to create these
element types.

To get the templates to properly execute, make sure that the PERL_LOADER
bricolage.conf directive loads HTML::Entities and the burner mode constants:

  PERL_LOADER = use HTML::Entities; use Bric::Util::Burner qw(:modes);

And finally, You will need to modify the site tag in elements.xml. Consult the
Bricolage Website and documentation for details.
