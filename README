bricolage.cc Templates & Element Types 1.21
===========================================

This package contains all of the templates and element type definitions (the
latter in XML, exported from the Bricolage SOAP server) for the bricolage.cc
Web site. It's not meant for direct import into an existing Bricolage server,
although it is possible to peform such a direct import by modifying the
Bricolage server and the "element_types.xml" file. To do so, you must set up
the following output channels (or modify "element_types.xml" to a similar
model):

Output Channel     Includes
-----------------  ---------------
Library
XHTML              Library
Slugged XHATML     XHTML, Library
Archive            XHTML, Library
RSS                Library
Mason              Library
Introspect         Library

Then you can simply use the element_types.xml file to create these element
types.

To get the templates to properly execute, make sure that the PERL_LOADER
bricolage.conf directive loads HTML::Entities and the burner mode constants:

  PERL_LOADER = use HTML::Entities; use Bric::Util::Burner qw(:modes);

And finally, You will need to modify the site tag in element_types.xml.
Consult the Bricolage Website and documentation for details.
