bricolage.cc Templates & Element Types 1.4
==========================================

This package contains all of the element types, output channels, utility
categories, sites, and templates used to create the bricolage.cc Web site in
Bricolage. If you're just interested in the templates, browse in templates/,
where they are all divided up by output channel. But if you have a brand
spankin' new install of Bricolage, you can import all of these objects into it
using `bric_soap`. Here's how:

  bric_soap --username admin --password 'change me now!' site update \
    xml/sites.xml
  bric_soap --username admin --password 'change me now!' output_channel \
    create xml/output_channels.xml
  bric_soap --username admin --password 'change me now!' element_type update \
    xml/pull_quote.xml
  bric_soap --username admin --password 'change me now!' element_type create \
    xml/element_types.xml
  bric_soap --username admin --password 'change me now!' category create \
    xml/categories.xml
  bric_soap --username admin --password 'change me now!' template create \
    xml/templates.xml

To get the templates to properly execute, make sure that the PERL_LOADER
bricolage.conf directive loads HTML::Entities and the burner mode constants:

  PERL_LOADER = use HTML::Entities; use Bric::Util::Burner qw(:modes);

Even still, previews likely won't work properly, as the Bricolage Web site
uses Mason on its front-end to assemble pages, and a bunch of Mason components
and style sheets are necessary to make it all work. But at least this will
help get you started. It might be simplest to skip creating the templqtes and
just browse them in 'templates/' and create them as you need them.
