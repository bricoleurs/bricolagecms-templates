bricolage.cc Templates & Elements 1.11
======================================

This package contains all of the templates and element definitions (in XML,
exported from the Bricolage SOAP server) for the bricolage.cc Web site. It's
not meant for direct import into an existing Bricolage server, although it is
possible to peform such a direct import by modifying the Bricolage server and
the "elements.xml" file. To do so, you must set up the following output
channels (or modify "elements.xml" to a similar model):

Output Channel     Includes
-----------------  ---------------
Library
XHTML              Library
Slugged XHATML     XHTML, Library
Archive            XHTML, Library
RSS                Library
Mason              Library
Introspect         Library

You must also set up the following Element Types:

  * Subelement
  * Related Story
  * Related Media and Story
  * Related Media
  * Fixed Document
  * Document
  * Image
  * Fixed Image
  * Fixed Files
  * Audio

Or, if you've installed Bricolage from "trunk" branch of thethe Subversion
repository, you can simply use the element_types.xml file to create the element
types.

And finally, You will need to modify the site tag in elements.xml. Consult the
Bricolage Website and documentation for details.
