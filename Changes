Revision history for bricolage.cc Templates & Elements
======================================================

1.01
      - Added trailing slash to the "Changelog" link in the
        link_to_download.mc XHTML template.
      - Fixed Article XHTML template to properly republish the Archive when it
        is published.
      - The title of each page is now stripped of XHTML before being used
        in the title tag in the header.
      - The title tag now uses an m-dash between the name of the site and the
        name of the page.
      - Error messages thrown by templates now get the name of the element
        from the element object and display the proper element number.
      - RSS feeds now have XHTML stripped from the title of each article,
        since most RSS newsreaders can't seem to tell that it's XHTML.
