Revision history for bricolage.cc Templates & Elements
======================================================

1.11
      - Modified the archive lookup template to look up only article documents
        associated with the "Bricolage Developers" source. This is to exclude
        the "Article Document Model" document, which is sourced to
        "Introspection", from the archives.
      - Fixed various parameter passing bugs in the RSS and Mason Archive
        templates.
      - Fixed bug in handling of keywords in "story_list.mc".
      - Added "category_uri" parameter to "story_list.mc" to specify a
        category other than the current category to search for related
        stories.
      - Added "by_cover_date" parameter to "story_list.mc" so that stories
        can be searched for and returned in reverse order by cover date
        rather than first publish date.

1.10  2004-08-19T23:45:53
      - Added trailing slash to the "Changelog" link in the
        link_to_download.mc XHTML template.
      - Fixed Article XHTML template to properly republish the Archive when it
        is published.
      - The title of each page is now stripped of XHTML before being used
        in the title tag in the header.
      - The title tag now uses an m-dash between the name of the site and the
        name of the page.
      - Error messages thrown by templates now get the name of the element
        from the element object and display the proper element number.
      - RSS feeds now have XHTML stripped from the title of each article,
        since most RSS newsreaders can't seem to tell that it's XHTML.
      - Added Introspection output channel and templates.
      - Added "Document Models" document type.
      - Added "Download Shortcut" subelement to the "Changes" document, so
        that there can be a clear link to the download descibed by the
        changes.

1.00  2004-07-28T20:13:54
      - Initial public release.
